# Poodle: Shift Scheduler

## Overview

### Project summary

Handicapped people in Denmark need to schedule their own personal
helpers after collecting everyone's availabilities. This app solves
the time-consuming and cognitively complex task of scheduling by a
two-pronged approach: deterministic—to eliminate
all impossible assignments and to greatly restrict the size of all potential
solutions; exploratory—to try to find a path in a graph which satisfies given constraints.
